## Compounding Workflow Efficiency Analysis (Pharmacy Operations Project)
This is my own excel project on analyzing workflow for a compounding pharmacy

I created a dynamic dashboard visualization in Excel using Pivot Tables, slicers, and interactive charts to optimize our compounding pharmacy workflow. The data was manually input from the compounding calendar, which we used to schedule our workflow with patients. This allowed for better trend analysis and real-time decision-making to improve efficiency. Additionally, I utilized Power BI to enhance data visualization, providing clearer insights for decision-making

Tools: Excel, Data Cleaning, Trend Analysis, Capacity Planning

## What I Learned
- How to capture and structure operational pharmacy data to support decision-making
- Identifying and quantifying bottlenecks using Excel-based analysis
- Recognizing how compound categories differ in prep time, hazard level, and scheduling load
- Translating real-world workflow patterns into actionable operational insights

Impact & Value
- This analysis provided to my pharmacy manager and director with clear visibility into daily production constraints and highlighted where capacity must be expanded before the pharmacy can scale. The project also lays the groundwork for:
- A capacity-based scheduling model
- Better distribution of workload among compound types
