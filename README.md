## Workflow Analysis
This is my own excel project on analyzing workflow for a compounding pharmacy

I created a dynamic dashboard visualization in Excel using Pivot Tables, slicers, and interactive charts to optimize our compounding pharmacy workflow. The data was manually input from the compounding calendar, which we used to schedule our workflow with patients. This allowed for better trend analysis and real-time decision-making to improve efficiency. Additionally, I utilized Power BI to enhance data visualization, providing clearer insights for decision-making
